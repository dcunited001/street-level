This is a demo site written with Refinery CMS to demonstrate creating and integrating custom engines.

It contains 3 engines that were written using the refinery generator:
- Events
- Sponsors
- Videos

The demo site also contains 4 models that integrate the engines:
- EventRsvp
- EventType
- SponsorshipLevel
- EventSponsorship
 
Here's the commands that were used to generate the site:
refinerycms street-level
cd street-level
bundle install
rake db:create:all
rake db:migrate
echo "gem 'refinerycms-testing'" >> Gemfile
rails generate refinerycms_testing 
bundle exec rake rspec
bundle exec rake cucumber
rails generate refinery_engine event name:string desc:text start:datetime end:datetime eventtype_id:integer pic:image visible:boolean
rails generate refinery_engine video name:string desc:text url:string user_id:integer
rails generate refinery_engine sponsor name:string twitter:string desc:text pic:image visible:boolean
bundle install
rails generate refinerycms_events
rails generate refinerycms_videos
rails generate refinerycms_sponsors
rake db:migrate
rails server



Please note: When the tests are run with rake spec, the database is loaded with db:schema:load,
    instead of db:migrate, so all the seeds are not created.  I've tried to hook in db:seeds as a
    requirement for the test task, which works, but when it seeds the data, it must not be using the
    test environment.  So, at the moment, my acceptance tests are not passing.  I've posted on the
    RefineryCMS group, but haven't heard anything back so far.
