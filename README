This is a demo site written with Refinery CMS to demonstrate creating and integrating custom engines.

It contains 3 engines that were written using the refinery generator:
- Events
- Sponsors
- Videos

The demo site also contains 4 models that integrate the engines:
- EventRsvp
- EventType
- SponsorshipLevel
- EventSponsorship
 
Here's the commands that were used to generate the site:
refinerycms street-level
cd street-level
bundle install
rake db:create:all
rake db:migrate
echo "gem 'refinerycms-testing'" >> Gemfile
rails generate refinerycms_testing 
bundle exec rake rspec
bundle exec rake cucumber
